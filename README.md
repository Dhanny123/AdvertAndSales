## 📝 Project Overview

The **Sales Prediction Model** leverages machine learning techniques to forecast sales figures by analyzing investments in platforms such as:
- **TV Advertising**
- **Radio Advertising**
- **Social Media Ads**
- **Online Search Campaigns**

The goal is to enable businesses to make data-driven decisions and improve their advertising strategy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses raw advertising data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides visualizations and insights into the relationship between advertising spend and sales.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Trains a regression model to predict sales based on input investment data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.
- **User-Friendly Deployment**: Includes a simple interface (e.g., Flask app or CLI) to input investment data and receive sales predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data manipulation.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `Scikit-learn` for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Environment**:
  - Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis.
  - Flask/Django (optional) for model deployment.
